Due to time contraints, I was not able to write a k-means algorithm to seperate the data into its 19 groupings, so I seperated them by hand and did the calculations in excel. 

Since the prompt says that Xtern Xpress also had a charging bus, I am going to assume that the scooters charge at 1 power level per hour on their charging station and they charge faster on the bus. I am also assuming that the bus must be parked while the scooters are charging. I am also assuming that the roads all have similar traffic levels and are fairly direct between charging stations.

Based on the average and mode power levels, the most popular scooter location is either the one around (0.75, 0.6) or (-0.1, -0.1). They have the lowest average power levels and also have very low mode power levels. 

My suggestion for the path of the mega bus is to first stop at (0.7, 0.8), taking scooters at 0, stopping at ~15% bus capacity. The next stop would be at (0.75, 0.6), filling to ~65% capacity with scooter at 0 or 1, prioritizing those at 0. Finally, stop at (-0.1, -0.1) filling until the station has no scooters under 2 or the bus fills up. If the bus is full, go back to its parking/charging station. If it is not, take a similar path up to (1.3, 0.9), filling up with scooters from that station.
